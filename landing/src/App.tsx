              Fieldnote\u2019s core math is the session-RPE method (duration \u00d7 effort,
              Foster et al., 2001) and the acute:chronic workload ratio, with 0.8\u20131.3 as
              the commonly cited optimal range (Gabbett, 2016). Published critiques of the
              ratio exist (e.g., Impellizzeri et al., 2020), so Fieldnote treats it as a
              screening prompt for a conversation \u2014 never a diagnosis.
